Ques- Palindrome Number

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

In this program,USER is  Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

*************CODE *******

class Solution {
 public boolean isPalindrome(int num){
   if(num < 0) 
       return false; 
   int reversed = 0, remainder, original = num;
   while(num != 0) {
        remainder = num % 10;
        reversed = reversed * 10 + remainder;
        num  /= 10;
    }
    return original == reversed;
 }
}

Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
