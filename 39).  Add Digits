Ques-  Add Digits 

Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.
add digits of a number until the number becomes a single-digit number. The problem is also known as the digit root problem.

Example 1:
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Constraints:-
0 <= num <= 231 - 1

Complexity Analysis-
Time Complexity: O(1).
Space Complexity: O(1).

************CODE**************** 
public class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num)
    {
        return num==0?0:(num%9==0?9:(num%9));
    }
}

SAMPLE OUTPUT-
Your input
95318
Output
8
